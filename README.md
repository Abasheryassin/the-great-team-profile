# THE GREAT TEAM BUILDER

## Description

Keeping track of your team and their various information and be a hassle. This project attempts to streamline the building of a team portfolio filled with all the necessary information. During this project I learned how to save a user's input and render the information out later, even dividing the data into subcategories.

## Installation

Just download the repository and type in node index.js to run the program. Following that, a series of prompts will appear, fill in the necessary information and finalize your team.

## Usage

Down below is an example screenshot of a created webpage using this program as well as a demonstration video.
